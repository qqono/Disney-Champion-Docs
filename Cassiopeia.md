# Cassiopeia

## Q -

	Psuedo-request: Aggressive mode

#### PvP:
Harass:
	Heavy restrictions
		In harass mode, Q is heavily restricted and will only be cast if it will surely hit
		Aggressive mode bypasses restrictions and will cast instantly without logic

Combo:
	Medium Restrictions
	Less restricted than harass, but still uses conditional logic
	Aggressive mode bypasses restrictions and will cast instantly without logic

	- Rylai logic
	- Advanced Menu contains hit chance and trigger settings
	- Aggressive mode will spam more and allows max range casts

#### PvE:
Essential Settings:
	Requires turbo mode + fast clear (LMB)
		- Will try Q multiple minions

	The Advanced settings menu contains configuration options for PvE Q.
	If you'd like Q to be cast in eco mode, or without LMB, change that here.


## W -

	Psuedo-request: Defensive mode

- Combo / Request only
- Will be used aggressively in some situations
	- eg: Immobile enemy, incoming teleport, zhonyas, antigap


## E -
- Fight Combo / Harass no restrictions
- Prioritises poisoned targets
- All modes configurable similar to Q farm, 
	- turbo restrictions
	- agro restrictions
	- jungle type restrictions, etc
	- everything can be configured, but essential settings should be fine


## R -
- Fight Combo only, configurable
- Flash R keybind 

	- Hard toggle option
	- Minimum hits
	- Facing only 
	- Very configurable, it's recommended to take a look at the advanced settings menu

You should setup how you want R to be used automatically (it's very playstyle dependent), and use Keybind/Override to request it when you otherwise need it.

*An example configuration might look like:
		Have R set to only cast on multiple targets, unless requested.
		This allows you to hold R for a better situation.
