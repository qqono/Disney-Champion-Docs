> q pseudoe requrst aggresive mode reduces the hitchance requeriments and removes the security restrictions that by default are expensive to avoid dying for casting spell q often
> 
> w pseudo request it cast spell on prediction like it was a circle spell, the chance of hit is very low thats why is behind hotkey, should not be abused or expected to hit in most of the scenarios is just miss unless the guy is chasing you so he has to either stop chasing, go around the trap, if he keeps chasing he will get hit yes
> 
> the part where you say placements under enemy clicks idk wtf is this shit, remove, its just automatic placement on events, multiple events cc being one of them, teleport another and hundred more from disney core
> 
> e you dont mention that it is also casted in combo for an aggresive playstyle, it can be disabled to only cast for antigap and defensive hotkey, by default cast on spacebar hold once meets certain conditions
> 
> pseudo request aggresive mode is totally wrong, you have to request it by either keybind or override, the aggresive mode can bypass checks such as killable or collision which is configurable

Doesn't Q enough

- "e you dont mention that it is also casted in combo for an aggresive playstyle, it can be disabled to only cast for antigap and defensive hotkey, by default cast on spacebar hold once meets certain conditions"

can this be aggressive mode only option?
